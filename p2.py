BSA Vacuum Cleaner Coverage
=================================

[IMPORTANT] This Python script has been created from scratch by Sam, with appropriate
references where necessary. Docstrings have been generated with the assistance of
AI for clarity and documentation purposes.

This module implements a BSA algorithmic system for a robotic vacuum cleaner. It
provides classes and functions to manage the robot's process states, map the
environment, and navigate through a grid-based representation of the area. The
system supports various navigation strategies, including pathfinding and state
management during cleaning operations.
